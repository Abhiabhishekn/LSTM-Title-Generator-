In this project, we propose the development of a YouTube video title generator utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The primary objective is to create engaging and captivating video titles for YouTube content creators. The data is taken from Kaggle for three countries. Data contains three csv files for the YouTube videos the data is for following three countries- US, Canada, UK. It contains information about various Youtube videos, such as their Video Id, Trending Date, Title, Channel Title, and other relevant details. This report presents a neural network model which is LSTM, for the title generation. It covers some of the crucial data wrangling steps to format the data for analysis and visualization
